## 📦 What's Included

This template includes:

- **React**
- **Vite**
- **ESLint** with recommended rules
- **HMR** for instant updates during development

Currently, two official Vite plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) (uses Babel for Fast Refresh)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) (uses SWC for Fast Refresh)

## 🔍 Expanding the ESLint Configuration

If you're developing a **production-ready** app, we highly recommend using **TypeScript** with type-aware linting rules.  
Explore the official [React + TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) and integrate it with [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) for stricter, safer code.
